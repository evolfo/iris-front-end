			          Creating music has always been a huge part of my life, but I couldnâ€™t do it without the love and support of the people around me, my community. Making music that is able to touch others, no matter their background or how they identify themselves, is something I feel very passionate about. Knowing that you are here because you heard a song of mine that struck a chord with you, or made your heart move in peculiar and new ways, makes me endlessly grateful.
			          So first of all, I want to acknowledge YOU. Thank you for listening and for keeping the music alive. I look forward to seeing you inside!</h6>
